# Libft

Libft is the first project at 1337/42 Network, where students build their own implementation of the standard C library functions from scratch.
The goal is to understand how core C functions work under the hood, improve problem-solving skills, and create a custom library to reuse in later projects.


# ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The Libft project consists of recreating many of the functions from <string.h>, <ctype.h>, and other standard C libraries.
The final product is a static library (libft.a) that can be linked to other C programs.

This project builds a strong foundation in:

Pointers and memory management

String manipulation

Linked lists and data structures

Writing clean, reusable, and tested code
